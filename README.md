# algorithm_solutions

**About**
This repository contains my solutions to the LeetCode Blind 75 problem set. The Blind 75 problem set is a curated list of frequently asked interview questions on LeetCode, designed to help developers prepare for technical interviews.

**Approach**
In solving these problems, I used a combination of my own approaches and some prpblems were solved using inspiration from neetcode.io. 
I approached each problem systematically, analyzing the requirements, constraints, and edge cases before devising an efficient solution.

**Language Used**
All solutions in this repository are implemented using Python, a powerful and versatile programming language. 
This choice is influenced by my love for Python during my internship at hotels.ng and also to handle big integer situations.
Python is known for its simplicity, readability, and extensive collection of libraries, making it an excellent choice for solving algorithmic problems.

**Organization**
The repository contains Python file ( named according to the problem ad their problem number on leetcode) containing the solution code.

**Usage**
To use this repository, you can clone it locally using the following command in your command line or terminal:

git clone https://github.com/adelajaOlamilekan/algorithm_solutions.git

Once cloned, you can navigate to the specific problem file and find the corresponding solution. Each solution is accompanied by detailed comments explaining the thought process and approach taken.

Feel free to explore the repository, examine the solutions, and modify them according to your needs. The code is provided as a reference, and I encourage you to understand the underlying algorithms and concepts before applying them in your own projects.

**Disclaimer**
Please note that while I have made every effort to ensure the accuracy and correctness of the solutions, there may be alternative approaches or optimizations that could be explored. The solutions provided here are not intended to be the definitive answers, but rather a starting point for your own learning and exploration.

**Contributing**
If you have any suggestions, improvements, or alternative solutions for any of the problems, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions are greatly appreciated!
